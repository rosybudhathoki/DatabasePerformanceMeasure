Libraries: pymongo, MongoDb Coded in python

Imports: datetime,sys,argparse,os,bson.json_util import loads

The main goal is to write a few queries using MongoDB as the underlying database system, to see the differences 
between using embedded and normalized document models. 
The queries will be embedded into separate Python applications that will make use of the PyMongo library.
